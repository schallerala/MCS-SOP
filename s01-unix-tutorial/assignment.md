# Series S01: Unix Tutorial

## 1\. Reading (optional)

Get the book [B. Kernighan, D. Ritchie, The C Programming Language, 2nd Ed., Prentice Hall, 1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) English, French or German. Browse it, and study the C codes in chap. 1.1. Also have a look at the C codes in chap. 1.6 – 1.10.

## 2\. Moodle Registration

Moodle is used to hand-in the exercieses. Subscribe to the Moodle module: [IN.2020 System-oriented Programming [SP 21]](https://moodle.unifr.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=857942)

## 3\. First Unix Contact

Explore the topics on the island which is represented as stops on the "outils linux" hiking trail.

**Remark 1:** For Windows users, we recommend to install the WSL – Windows subsystem for Linux (see the "WSL" pole).
**Remark 2:** A very good knowledge of this topic is mandatory for the rest of this course! Play around a little and imagine your own Unix commands.
Make sure that you have a machine with working UNIX environment for the next class.

## 4\. First steps with C

With the goal to get the feeling of the C language use the [sandbox](/#bac-a-sable) to test out some simple code snippets.

## 5\. wc Unix Utility

A word count utility, named wc, is available in most Unix shells. Try out several variants of the following command (hint: consult wc's man page):

```shell
$ [options] [file…]
```

Then propose two enhanced wc usages, one using [options] and one using [file…] and give a short explanation.

## 6\. Interactive Bash Tutorial (optional)
