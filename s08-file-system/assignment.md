Exercise 8
==========


1. Create the function to\_upper(s)
-----------------------------------


Create the function to\_upper(s) which takes a String s as input and returns a String where all ASCII letters (a-z) are transformed to upper case, the other characters stay the same.




2. Create one version which uses toupper(c) from <ctype.h>.

4. Then extent the program with a function implementing your self toupper(c).



**Hint:** To reimplement toupper(c) inspect closely the ASCII table of the lower, and upper case letters. The solution can be realized with simple arithmetic!


2. Write a program which writes to stdout and stderr.
-----------------------------------------------------




2. Write a tiny program which outputs alternating “hey!” to stdout and then “ho!” to stderr. In between the two output of the program shall sleep for 1 second.

4. Write a bash command which writes all outputs of the stdout to the file hey.txt and all the output of the stderr to the file ho.txt



3. Project P01: Linked Data In-Memory Store
-------------------------------------------


After the project set-up with some dummy information try to define some data “by hand” and start to work on the match() function.




* Define a data structure which you then fill with some example information statically (see the example from the [project description](https://unifr.coursc.ch/#projet)). Make sure to define it outside the match() function.

* As a first step see if you can printf() all the triples which match the char* S variable.
